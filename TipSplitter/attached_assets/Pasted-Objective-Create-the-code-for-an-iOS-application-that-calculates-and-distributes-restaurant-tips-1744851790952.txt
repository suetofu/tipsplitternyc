Objective:

Create the code for an iOS application that calculates and distributes restaurant tips among staff after each shift, based on hours worked and position-based point values.

1. Initial App Setup (First Launch Only)


Upon installation, prompt the user to configure:

Restaurant Name

Shift Types (e.g., Lunch, Brunch, Dinner, or custom)

Positions and Default Point Values

Example: Server = 1.0, Bartender = 1.0, Busser = 0.5, etc.

These defaults must be editable later and override-able per shift

Upload Employee Database:

First & Last Name

Employee ID

Position(s) they can hold (only one will be assigned per shift)

2. Per-Shift Entry Workflow


Each shift requires the following inputs:



A. 
Shift Details
Date and Type (e.g., “Dinner – April 13, 2024”)

Tip Amounts:

Credit Card Tips

House Tips

Cash Tips



Important Tip Distribution Rule:
All three tip types (credit card, house, and cash) are distributed proportionally based on the employee’s earned shift points.
Credit Card Tips + House Tips are grouped together as “digital tips” in the UI/output.
Cash Tips are displayed separately.
Cash is not included in the digital tips total.
B. 
Employee Selection


For each shift:

Select participating employees from the stored list.

For each:

Clock-in and Clock-out times

Hours are calculated as decimals (e.g., 7.75 hours)

Rounding behavior (15/30/45/60 min) is configurable by the user

Position worked during the shift (only one per employee)

Position Point Value (default from setup, but editable per shift)

3. Tip Calculation Logic
Hours Worked = Clock-out – Clock-in (as decimal)

Shift Points per Employee = Hours Worked × Position Point Value

Total Points for Shift = Sum of all employee points

For Each Employee:

Digital Tip Share = (Employee Points / Total Points) × (Credit Card + House Tips)

Cash Tip Share = (Employee Points / Total Points) × Cash Tips

4. Output Summary


For each employee, display:

Name

Employee ID

Position

Hours Worked

Points Earned

Digital Tips (Credit Card + House)

Cash Tips



Validate that:
Total of all Digital Tips matches original Credit Card + House input
Total of all Cash Tips matches original Cash input
5. CSV Export


Allow export of each shift summary as a CSV file, containing all the data above.
